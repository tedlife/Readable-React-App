## Intro

This is a project build with React, React Router, Redux, ESlint and Ant Design. You can add, delete and vote a post or comment. You can also sort the posts by time and votes.

## Getting Started

1. Install the project's dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the project's development server with `npm start`.
3. Go into the `api-server` folder and run the API server with `npm run start`. The url should be `http://localhost:3001`.
